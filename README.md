# To-do List Excercise

![To-do list screenshot](Share_Your_Styled_ToDo_List.png)

## Description
You can enter a new list item by typing it into the field at the bottom and delete an item by clicking on the item's name. This was an exercise in changing state with React and refactoring code using multiple files.

## How To Run
Fork the repository and clone it to your machine. If you don't have npm installed, you can get it by installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run 'npx http-server' from the command line to run a temporary [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or install http-server as a global command by running 'npm install --global http-serverâ€™. If you install the global http-server command, run 'http-server' to start a server or run 'http-server -c-1' to prevent the browser from caching if you want to make changes. You can then access the page by going to localhost:8080 in your web browser.
